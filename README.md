# Project Vishnu

Project Vishnu is a 1 credit hour college project aimed to protect small and big businesses in the cyber world from data breaches and zero-day vulnerabilities from the user end. We aim to use the cyber force of the citizens to protect our own businesses' testing from the user end. Although there are major bug bounty platforms in Nepal, we added some of the features that weren't available in those making it to a whole new level.
